# Data Analysis Course

This repo will house the code I made for my Data Analysis in the Social Sciences course from Fall 2017. Greg Eirich taught this course as part of the QMSS program at Columbia University. These were my early days in R, so forgive the code.

Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics, Subgroup Summaries, & Cross Tabulating Variables (data in folder)

Lab 2: Variable Recoding & Transformations, Linear Regression, Early Data Visualization (same data as Lab 1).

Lab 3: Bivariate Regression, mMdiating Variables, Dummy Variables, Partial F-test (same data as Lab 1).

Lab 4: Multivariate Regression, Interaction Terms, Data Visualization, ANOVA

Lab 5: Linear Probability Modeling, Logistic Regression, Odds Ratios, Predicted Probabilities

Lab 6: (Time Series) Pooled OLS Regression, First Difference Estimation
