# data-analysis-class

This repo will house the code I made for my Data Analysis in the Social Sciences course from Fall 2017. This readme will be work in progress until I successfully upload everything. These were my early days in R, so forgive the code.

Lab 1: Descriptive Statistics, Subgroup Summaries, & Cross Tabulating Variables (data in folder)

Lab 2: Variable Recoding, Cross Tabulating Variables, Linear Regression, Early Data Visualization (same data as Lab 1).
